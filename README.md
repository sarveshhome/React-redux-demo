# React and redux demo app

rfc stands for React Functional Component.

It is a shorthand snippet used in VS Code with the ES7+ React/Redux/React-Native snippets extension.

Typing rfc and hitting Tab will auto-generate this code:

```
import React from 'react';

const ComponentName = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      
    </div>
  );
};

export default ComponentName;

```
